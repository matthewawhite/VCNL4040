# VCNL4040
This is the code developed for the VCNL4040 proximity sensor for the purpose of increasing better ball detection for the robots.

# Setup
Check the pin locations for the sensor in the datasheet and connect to the respective pins on a microcontroller (the software was developed with the ARM Mbed for testing and may not work with other microcontrollers)

# Data
At the moment, the data the sensor is being returned is not in any understandable units such as cm, and so data was collected for a rough formula that connects the returned value to cm however this needs to be vastly improved.
